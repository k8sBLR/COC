Kubernetes Bangalore Meetup strives to create an inclusive community for everyone interested in Kubernetes technology regardless of their background, ethnicity, colour, race, culture, citizenship, gender, etc. Although communication in the community is mainly in English, being a common denominator language but it is by no means a factor of discrimination.
